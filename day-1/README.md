# Day 1 – From Prompt to Action

## Overview
Day 1 explores how to turn natural-language prompts into agent actions. The `1. Introduction to Agents` PDF frames the problem space, while the notebooks implement prompt-to-action flows and compare agent architectures.

## Contents
- `day-1a-from-prompt-to-action.ipynb`: Builds a simple agent loop that plans, acts, and reflects using structured prompts.
- `day-1b-agent-architectures.ipynb`: Surveys single-tool, multi-tool, and hierarchical agent designs with hands-on code cells.
- `1. Introduction to Agents.pdf`: Slide-style recap covering terminology plus the evaluation rubric used through the course.

## How to use this day
1. Skim the PDF to recall the design principles that guide the lab work.
2. Open notebook A to rehearse the core agent loop and adapt it to your favorite model provider.
3. Advance to notebook B to stress-test multiple architectures with your own scenarios.
