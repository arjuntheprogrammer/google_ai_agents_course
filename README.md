# Google 5-Day Agents Course

These are my working notes, notebooks, and downloadable PDFs from Google's five-day Agents learning path on Kaggle. Each day introduces a focused aspect of building, tooling, and shipping AI agents, and the repo is organized so I can quickly revisit a specific topic or rerun the companion notebooks locally or on Kaggle.

## Repository structure

| Folder | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| `day-1` | From prompts to multi-step agent plans and core agent architectures.
| `day-2` | Tool use patterns plus Model Context Protocol (MCP) interoperability best practices.
| `day-3` | Session management, conversation memory, and context engineering for long-running agents.
| `day-4` | Observability and evaluation methods to keep agents reliable in production.
| `day-5` | Agent-to-agent collaboration and deployment considerations for real users.

Each folder contains two Kaggle notebooks (`*-a` and `*-b`) plus a PDF recap for offline reading. Final reminders/announcements from the learning path are intentionally excluded so the repo focuses on the hands-on content.

## Usage

1. Open any notebook in Kaggle or JupyterLab to replay the exercises (`kaggle kernels push` also works if you want to version them on Kaggle directly).
2. Read the matching PDF first if you want a conceptual refresher before diving into code.
3. Use the per-day README files for a quick synopsis of goals and prerequisites.

## Next steps

- [ ] Run through the notebooks again with your own API keys or MCP tool stacks.
- [ ] Capture personal learnings in the day-level READMEs as you revisit the material.
