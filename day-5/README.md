# Day 5 – Collaboration & Deployment

## Overview
Day 5 wraps up the course with multi-agent collaboration patterns and deployment guidance so that prototypes can reach production.

## Contents

## How to use this day
1. Skim the PDF to identify the deployment model that best matches your stack (serverless, container, etc.).
2. Run notebook A to experiment with collaboration strategies (e.g., coordinator-worker, debate, peer review).
3. Take notebook B as a checklist for deploying to your preferred platform while keeping observability wired in.
