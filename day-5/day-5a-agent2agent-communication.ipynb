In production:\n- Product Catalog Agent would run on vendor's infrastructure (e.g., `https://vendor.com`)\n- Customer Support Agent would run on your infrastructure\n- They'd communicate over the internet using A2A protocol\n\nThis local simulation lets you learn A2A without needing to deploy services!\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 What We'll Build\n\nHere's a high-level view of the system architecture you'll create in this tutorial:\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day5/a2a_02.png)\n\n**How it works:**\n1. **Customer** asks a product question to your Customer Support Agent\n2. **Support Agent** realizes it needs product information\n3. **Support Agent** calls the **Product Catalog Agent** via A2A protocol\n4. **Product Catalog Agent** (external vendor) returns product data\n5. **Support Agent** formulates an answer and responds to the customer\n\n---\n\n### 🗺️ Tutorial Steps\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll complete **6 steps**:\n\n1. **Create the Product Catalog Agent** - Build the vendor's agent with product lookup\n2. **Expose via A2A** - Make it accessible using `to_a2a()`\n3. **Start the Server** - Run the agent as a background service\n4. **Create the Customer Support Agent** - Build the consumer agent\n5. **Test Communication** - See A2A in action with real queries\n6. **Understand the Flow** - Learn what happened behind the scenes\n\nLet's get started! 🚀","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!

The A2A request was sent over HTTP to `http://localhost:8001` (highlighted in yellow)\n6. **Product Catalog Agent** (server) received the request and called `get_product_info(\"iPhone 15 Pro\")`\n7. **Product Catalog Agent** returned the product information via A2A response\n8. **RemoteA2aAgent** received the response and passed it back to the Support Agent\n9. **Support Agent** formulated a final answer with the product details\n10. **Customer** received the complete, helpful response\n\n### Key Benefits Demonstrated\n\n1. **Transparency**: Support Agent doesn't \"know\" Product Catalog Agent is remote\n2. **Standard Protocol**: Uses A2A standard - any A2A-compatible agent works\n3. **Easy Integration**: Just one line: `sub_agents=[remote_product_catalog_agent]`\n4. **Separation of Concerns**: Product data lives in Catalog Agent (vendor), support logic in Support Agent (your company)\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nThis pattern enables:\n- **Microservices**: Each agent is an independent service\n- **Third-party Integration**: Consume agents from external vendors (e.g., product catalogs, payment processors)\n- **Cross-language**: Product Catalog Agent could be Java, Support Agent Python\n- **Specialized Teams**: Vendor maintains catalog, your team maintains support agent\n- **Cross-Organization**: Vendor hosts catalog on their infrastructure, you integrate via A2A","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🎓 Next Steps and Learning Resources\n\n### 🚀 Enhancement Ideas\n\nNow that you understand A2A basics, try extending this example:\n\n1. **Add More Agents**:\n   - Create an **Inventory Agent** that checks stock levels and restocking schedules\n   - Create a **Shipping Agent** that provides delivery estimates and tracking\n   - Have Customer Support Agent coordinate all three via A2A\n\n2. **Real Data Sources**:\n   - Replace mock product catalog with real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)\n   - Add real inventory tracking system integration\n   - Connect to real payment gateway APIs\n\n3. **Advanced A2A Features**:\n   - Implement authentication between agents (API keys, OAuth)\n   - Add error handling and retries for network failures\n   - Use the alternative `adk api_server --a2a` approach\n\n4. **Deploy to Production**:\n   - Deploy Product Catalog Agent to Agent Engine\n   - Update agent card URL to point to production server (e.g., `https://vendor-catalog.example.com`)\n   - Consumer agents can now access it over the internet!\n\n### 📚 Documentation\n\n**A2A Protocol**:\n\n- [Official A2A Protocol Website](https://a2a-protocol.org/)\n- [A2A Protocol Specification](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/spec/)\n\n**ADK A2A Guides**:\n\n- [Introduction to A2A in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/a2a/intro/)\n- [Exposing Agents Quickstart](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/a2a/quickstart-exposing/)\n- [Consuming Agents Quickstart](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/a2a/quickstart-consuming/)\n\n**Other Deployment Options**:\n\n- [Deploy ADK Agents to Cloud Run](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/cloud-run/)\n- [Deploy to Agent Engine](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/)\n- [Deploy to GKE](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/gke/)","metadata":{"id":"Gjs0ZY1YDKyc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n## 📊 Summary - A2A Communication Patterns\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\nIn this notebook, you learned how to build multi-agent systems with A2A:\n\n- **A2A Protocol**: Standardized protocol for agent-to-agent communication across networks and frameworks\n- **Exposing Agents**: Use `to_a2a()` to make your agents accessible to others with auto-generated agent cards\n- **Consuming Agents**: Use `RemoteA2aAgent` to integrate remote agents as if they were local sub-agents\n- **Use Cases**: Best for microservices architectures, cross-team integrations, and third-party agent consumption","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n## ✅ Congratulations!
